  <h1>Images</h1>
  <p>Everybody loves images! They break up the text on a page and add visual stimulation for the user.  Nobody wants to look at a big page of text!

  <p><img src="../images/cat1.jpeg" width="125" hspace="10" padding="20" align="left" alt="Cat1">You can add your images in various locations, you can resize them, you can put a border around them and even add a caption to the image. Say, for instance, I had a hankering for a catâ€“I could put one right here in this paragraph. (But I probably wouldn't do that because I am allergic to cats.) I could also align the image on the other side and make it bigger.  It will look strange, but cats don't care.

  <p style="margin: 50px 0px 30px 0px">You can also just plop the full-sized image down right in the middle of your page! This one has a border around it:</p>

   <p style="margin: 50px 0px 30px 0px">I also use this image a lot when I am working with html:</p>
