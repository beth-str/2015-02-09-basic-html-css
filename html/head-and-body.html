  <h1>Head and Body</h1>
  <p>This section will explain the various parts of an html page.
  </p>

<h2>Head</h2>
<p>The head is the place where we put all the "secret" or private information pertaining to the page. Here are some things that would go in the <code>&lthead&gt</code> section:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Document type
  </li>
  <li>Page title
  </li>
  <li>The link to the style sheet (Or, if using in-line style, the style code would appear in this section as well (e.g., for html emails).)
  </li>
  <li>The character set required
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Body</h2>
  <p>The body section is where all the good stuff happensâ€“the things that actually appear in your browser when you look at the page! This would include all your headers and paragraphs, your lists, your images, and your tables.
  </p>

<h2>Footer</h2>
<p>Sometimes footers are used at the bottom of a page. These can contain additional information including: a sitemap, contact information, a company logo and other exciting things.</p>
