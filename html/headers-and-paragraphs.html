  <h1>Headers and Paragraphs</h1>
  <p>This page will explain the use of headers and paragraphs.
  </p>

<h2>Headers</h2>
  <p>Headers are a good way to call attention to certain things on your webpage. This helps the user navigate your site quickly by scanning for the things that are of interest to them.
  </p>
  <p>We can set various attributes for the header, thus giving it prominence through its size, color and text decoration.
  </p>
  
<h1 style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 50px">This is my H1 heading</h1>
<h2 style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 50px">This is my H2 heading</h2>
<h3 style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 50px">This is my H3 heading</h3>
<h4 style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 50px">And this is my poor little H4 heading. I made it so small because I want to use it at the top of my page to aid in navigation...</h4>
  <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
    <p>Paragraphs are the main way we display text, so they should be clean and easy-to-read.
    </p>

  <h3>Blockquote</h3>
    <p>How about a long quote from someone?  Perhaps in Latin to review your grade school classical training? This could go in a blockquote:
    </p>

      <blockquote>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat...<a href="">Read More</a></blockquote>

  <h3>Bold and Italics</h3>
    <p>If something is <em>super important</em>, you might want to emphasize it using italics.  Or you might want to make it <strong>bold</strong> so that it really stands out.  If you are going for serious text overkill, you could even use both (but that would be really <em><strong>dumb</strong></em>).
    </p>

  <h3>Links</h3>  
    <p>This is what a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="blank">link looks like</a>. It really stands out!
    </p>
