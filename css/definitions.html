<h1>Definitions</h1>
  <p>I am uncertain what this is asking for.  CSS defintions - does this mean definitions list?  Or a list of definitions related to CSS?  </p>
  <p>Is this just talking about the list of attributes you assign on the CSS style sheet?  Each CSS rule can have as many properties as you like. Each of them applies to the elements that the selector applies to.</p>
